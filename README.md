Creating 2.5D models of buildings purely from overhead imagery and deep learning

This visual was created by the qgis plugin qgis2threejs. The plugin was used to visualize my shapefile of predicted building footprints and building heights. The buildings are colored by the relative accuracy of the height predicitons.
